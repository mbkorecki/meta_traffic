dynamics of simple intersections
dynamics of the learning process 
dynamics of the network at inference




torus world, closed vs open systems
the appearing/disappearing dynamics is conditioned on the network parameters so that it can never learn it 


in the torus world, if the cars always have the same path and speed, then it is likely that the optimal solution would be periodic 

0. dqlearning, quantify the novelty of samples and use them for training proportionally to their novelty

1. the reward is dependent on the dynamics of the system, in a congested state less should be expected of the agent, the reward should be normalised relative to the dynamics of the system

2. optimal metrics (throughput, avg. travel time) can be computed exactly if we assume no conflicting movements; it can be approximated if we assume conflicts but know about their time dynamics

3. a system that goes through the experiences and improves decisions made, perhaps testing their effectiveness, some sort of memory-replay refinement or supervised learning on optimal decisions 

4. state can be represented as a graph of movements?

5. an intelligent system than works even when one of the intersection in the system is intelligent and gets incrementally better with more intersections

6. learning agents in the volunteer game, reinforcement learning, with the reward being the payoff
investigate the difference between systems where agents learn the global reward, vs individual reward, vs local, mezo-reward
how does learning affect the dynamics, what strategies are learned+evolved vs just evolved 

=================================================
Experiments on the small simulation/sphere-world: 
=================================================
A few scenarios run on the sphere-world or a simple network to study the dynamics of the system, especially the difference in dynamics between non-congested and congested states.

Start with the sphere and compare to a 2x1 network. 

----------------
Parametrization:
----------------
1. in-flow on each movement/the number of cars/density on each movement (if we assume cyclical)
2. paths of the cars: 
- easy setting: no conflicting movements
- harder setting: some conflicting movements
- hard setting: many conflicts 

--------
Metrics:
--------
1. flow at movements/lanes/intersection 
2. density at movements/lanes/intersection 
5. pressure 
4. number of stops 
7. speeds

6. selected phases
3. average travel time 
8. state?

9. spread/distribution of cars in the network

random movements, random lights

TODO:
- train model on normal scenario ensemble, test on disrupted 

1x1sphere: veh number:
30 - free flow
60 - medium low
120 - medium high
180 - breakdown










Resilience paper:
(1) to discuss and
expand the connections, relations and interdependencies between participation
and urban resilience, while defining the later in a holistic and precise way, and
(2), to provide an overview of the paths to assess the potential impact of such
participatory governance practices into resilience
- traffic system, intersection participate and interact to be more resilient
- ad-hoc networks, cooperation for greater resilience 
- game theoretic approach, critical mass of users, resilience related to participation 
- decentralization increases resilience
- real-world examples of technologies where participation improves resilience
